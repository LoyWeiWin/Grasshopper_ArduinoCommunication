# Grasshopper_ArduinoCommunication

**Grasshopper_ArduinoCommunication** enables seamless, real-time interaction between Grasshopper (a visual programming environment in Rhino) and Arduino boards via serial communication. This lightweight and adaptable bridge supports embedding interactivity, responsive environments, and sensor-driven logic into parametric design workflows.

## Features
- **Multi-Board Compatibility**: Supports Arduino UNO, NANO, and Mega boards.
- **Real-Time Bi-Directional Communication**: Exchange data dynamically between Grasshopper and Arduino over serial protocols.
- **Open & Extensible**: Designed to be lightweight and adaptable for prototyping, experimentation, and research.

## Requirements
- **Grasshopper**: Pre-installed in Rhino 7. *Note: The Firefly plugin is not supported in Rhino 8.*
- **Firefly Plugin**: Install the [Firefly Grasshopper Plugin](https://www.food4rhino.com/en/app/firefly) to establish the communication link. Compatible with Rhino 6 and 7.
- **Arduino IDE**: Use the [official Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software) to upload sketches to your board.  
  *(At the time of writing, Arduino IDE version 2.3.6 is used.)*
- **Arduino Boards**: UNO, NANO, and Mega models are supported.
