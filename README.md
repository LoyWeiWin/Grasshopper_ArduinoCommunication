# Grasshopper_ArduinoCommunication

The **Grasshopper_ArduinoCommunication** repo is designed to facilitate seamless interaction between Grasshopper and Arduino boards.

## Features
- **Compatibility:** Supports Arduino UNO, NANO, and Mega boards.
- **Real-time Communication:** Enables bi-directional communication between Grasshopper and Arduino via serial communication.

## Requirements
- **Grasshopper:** Ensure you have Grasshopper installed. Note: The Firefly plugin is not supported in Rhino 8.
- **Firefly Plugin:** Install the [Firefly Grasshopper Plugin](https://www.food4rhino.com/en/app/firefly) to enable communication between Grasshopper and Arduino. Use a Rhino version compatible with Firefly (e.g., Rhino 6 or 7).
- **Arduino IDE:** Install the [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software) to upload code to your Arduino boards.
- **Arduino Boards:** Compatible with Arduino UNO, NANO, and Mega.
