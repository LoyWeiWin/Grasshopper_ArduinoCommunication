# Grasshopper_ArduinoCommunication Library

The **Grasshopper_ArduinoCommunication** library is designed to facilitate seamless interaction between Grasshopper and Arduino boards. This library provides users with a suite of plugins to enhance communication and create a smoother, more intuitive workflow.

## Features
- **Compatibility:** Supports Arduino UNO, NANO, and Mega boards.
- **Real-time Communication:** Enables bi-directional communication between Grasshopper and Arduino via serial communication.

## Requirements
- **Grasshopper:** Ensure you have Grasshopper installed. Note: The Firefly plugin is not supported in Rhino 8.
- **Firefly Plugin:** Install the [Firefly Grasshopper Plugin](https://www.food4rhino.com/en/app/firefly) to enable communication between Grasshopper and Arduino. Use a Rhino version compatible with Firefly (e.g., Rhino 6 or 7).
- **Arduino IDE:** Install the [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software) to upload code to your Arduino boards.
- **Arduino Boards:** Compatible with Arduino UNO, NANO, and Mega.

## Example Use Cases
- Control LEDs, servos, or motors from Grasshopper.
- Read sensor data (e.g., temperature, light) into Grasshopper for further analysis.
- Develop interactive prototypes combining Grasshopper's computational design capabilities with Arduino's hardware interface.
